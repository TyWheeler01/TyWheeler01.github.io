  <p>The time I’ve spent in the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University and developing this ePortfolio have been extremely valuable. My experience here has not only built up my technical skills, but also clarified my career aspirations. This capstone project put together everything I’ve learned in this program and presents it in a way that shows my readiness to enter the field as a well rounded software developer. Throughout the program I’ve become proficient in applying computer science fundamentals across many different scenarios. From designing software to implementing efficient algorithms, I’ve aimed to demonstrate my ability to produce well built, maintainable and scalable solutions in all of my projects. This ePortfolio showcases my collective work and explains the reasoning behind my design and enhancement decisions.</p>

  <p>Learning how to collaborate in a team was an essential skill I developed throughout this program. In courses such as CS 250, Software Development Lifecycles, I worked on group projects that resembled how real world development team workflows operate. This included sprint planning, peer code reviews and iterative releases. These experiences not only taught me how to meaningfully contribute to a team, but also taught me how to communicate ideas clearly, delegate different tasks and resolve conflicts in a constructive manner. I learned to adapt my communication style to different audiences, peers and stakeholders in order to ensure that each group understood how the development process was progressing. This reflects the course outcome of employing strategies to foster collaborative environments that support organizational decision making. In courses such as CS 255, System Analysis and Design, I learned how to translate complex technical concepts into language that is easier for stakeholders to understand, and how to gather insightful user feedback to make more informed decisions about the overall design of the software. This ensures that the software I create meets both the functional goals and user's expectations.</p>

  <p>I’ve also developed a solid foundation in algorithms and data structures which I’ve applied across many different projects that required technical problem solving. One example is my work in CS 370, Current and Emerging Trends in CS, where I implemented a reinforcement learning agent capable of navigating a grid based environment using Q-learning. This project helped me understand how algorithmic principles can be translated into practical, real world intelligent systems. I enhanced the agent by incorporating a Double Deep Q-Network architecture which reduced overestimation bias and improved learning stability overall. This process required carefully examining the different design trade offs, such as balancing learning speed against accuracy. These enhancements directly align with the course outcome of designing and evaluating computing solutions using algorithmic techniques while considering their real world impact.</p>

  <p>In regard to software engineering and databases, I’ve designed full stack applications such as my Grazioso Salvare web app from CS 340, Client and Server Developement. I followed industry standard architectural patterns, such as MVC, and implemented secure RESTful APIs using Flask. Through this project I gained hands-on experience working SQL and NoSQL databases, and deepened my awareness of security in designing applications. In my enhancements I introduced role based access control to restrict sensitive operations, such as data deletion, to only admin users. I also separated the frontend from direct database access by routing all data interactions through an authenticated API layer. This mindset of anticipating potential vulnerabilities before they are exploited helped me identify issues in the original design and mitigate them by implementing authentication, permissions, and ensuring data privacy through controlled access patterns. These decisions directly reflect a security first approach and demonstrate my ability to architect systems that proactively guard against adversarial threats while ensuring reliable and maintainable code. My understanding of security deepened in CS 305, Software Security, as I developed a secure communications protocol for a financial web application using SHA-256 hashing to protect sensitive data. I also generated self signed certificates in order to enable HTTPS, verified checksums, and implemented secure client/server interactions. I also gained valuable experience in CS 320, Software Testing and Automation, where I explored test automation practices and learned to analyze defects in unit testing and system testing. This gave me a better appreciation for code quality and real world production readiness. All of these experiences taught me to prioritize security in every layer of the development process.</p>

  <p>Each artifact in this ePortfolio was selected to demonstrate a different course outcome and showcase the different skills I’ve gained throughout this program. My Goal Weight Tracker Android App highlights my ability to design user centered mobile applications using architectural best practices like MVVM and integrate secure features such as two-factor authentication. This directly reflects my understanding of software engineering principles and the ability to implement professional technical solutions that are tailored to the user needs. My Treasure Hunt Agent demonstrates algorithmic thinking and data structure application as I designed and evaluated a reinforcement learning model. I enhanced this model with Double DQN and Q-value visualization implementations. This artifact aligns with the course outcome focused on solving problems using algorithmic principles while managing trade-offs in model complexity and stability. The Grazioso Salvare Web Application showcases my experience with full-stack development, API security and role based access control, demonstrating a strong security mindset and a proactive approach to mitigating vulnerabilities and safeguarding user data. Additionally, all of my projects required clear documentation, technical communication, and potential stakeholder considerations. This fulfills the outcome related to professional oral, written and visual communication throughout development of all of my projects. My collaborative work in earlier courses and team based practices reflected throughout these enhancements display the outcome of building effective collaborative environments that support diverse decision making in the field of computer science. These artifacts all aim to showcase continual improvement, adaptability, and real world problem solving.</p>

  <p>In this code review I go over three major projects for enhancement that demonstrate profficiency in software design and engineering, algorithms and data structures, aswell as databases. Through all of these different projects I’ve identified weaknesses, proposed meaningful enhancements and aligned each improvement with the course outcomes.</p>

  <p style="margin-top: 20px;"> This Android application allows users to log their weight, set goal weights and receive notifications according the the milestones and goals they set. The original version of the app, built in Java using SQLite, lacked modern architecture, secure logins, and visual clarity. This enhanced version addresses these issues through a few significant updates. </p>

  <ul style="line-height: 1.6;">
    <li>Implemented a secure RESTful Flask API to handle the database interactions.</li>
    <li>Added role based access control to ensure only admin users could perform certain operations such as deleting records.</li>
    <li>Separated database logic from the UI by decoupling the Dash frontend from direct database calls.</li>
    <li>Improved modularity and maintainability by organizing code into MVC style components.</li>
